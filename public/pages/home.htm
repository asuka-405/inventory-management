    Vanilla-SPA is a lightweight template that provides a starting point for
    building single-page applications without relying on frameworks like React.
    It offers a simple and minimalistic approach to creating dynamic web
    applications, allowing developers to focus on the core functionality without
    the overhead of a larger framework. With Vanilla-SPA, you can easily create
    routes and handle navigation using vanilla JavaScript. It's a great choice
    for developers who prefer a more lightweight and customizable solution for
    building single-page apps.
